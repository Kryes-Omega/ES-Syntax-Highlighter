# ES-Syntax-Highlighter

## Overview

Endless Sky syntax highlighter for Notepad++

`EScriptThemeLight.xml` is the User Defined Language for ES and is made to look nice with the Default Notepad++ theme (black text on a white background).

`EScriptThemeDark.xml` is the User Defined Language for ES and is made to look nice with the `Default Dark theme.xml` theme (white text on a black background). Default Dark theme is a global dark background for NP++. Regular text editing will look fine in this, but I haven't bothered to edit the other languages so they all look really weird.

This ES syntax highlighting was mostly made for mission development, because that is where the most errors happen. I did add some support for other parts of the ES code, there were waaaay too many keywords to deal with, but of feel free to clean up or add to the theme if you get frustrated with the lack of Map syntax highlighting or something.

## Installation: 

You should only install one of these two options (light or dark, depending on your preference):

### Light (Normal/Default) Notepad++ Theme

#### EScriptThemeLight.xml
  Under the `Language` dropdown menu, press `Define your language...`, from there press `Import`, then navigate to and select `EScriptThemeLight.xml`. Under the `User defined language` dropdown in the UDL window, select Endless Sky then press `Save As`, name it `Endless Sky Data File`, and save it. The language will now be available under the `Language` dropdown. Just click on it and it will highlight all the words n' stuff.

### Dark Notepad++ Theme

#### EScriptThemeDark.xml
  Under the `Language` dropdown menu, press `Define your language...`, from there press `Import`, then navigate to and select `EScriptThemeDark.xml`. Under the `User defined language` dropdown in the UDL window, select Endless Sky then press `Save As`, name it, and save it. The language will now be available under the `Language` dropdown. Just click on it and it will highlight all the words n' stuff.
  
#### Default Dark theme.xml
  Under the `Settings` dropdown menu, go to `Import` > `Import style theme(s)...`, then navigate to and select `Default Dark theme.xml`. Go back to the `Settings` dropdown, select `Style Configurator`, and under the Select Theme dropdown menu select the Default Dark theme option. Save & Close and you're all set. As long as you like dark themes. Otherwise, deal wit it.
